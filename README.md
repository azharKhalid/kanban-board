## A brief explanation of the approach taken.
1. **Design Decisions**:
    - Tasks are managed via modular components and passed via props/state to promote reusability.
    - Constants, types, and reusable components are maintained in separate folders for clarity and scalability.
    - Memoization (useMemo) and React.memo are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

2. **Trade-offs and Limitations**
    - No authentication is included currently; the API calls fetch general tasks.
    - Minimal global state management; React Query handles API cache but Redux is not implemented yet.
    - Basic error/loading states are included, but further polish can be added.

## Possible Improvements.
  - Add user authentication (login/logout).
  - Fetch tasks based on the authenticated user.
  - Implement Redux Toolkit for better state management.
  - Persist task state (e.g., localStorage or backend).
  - Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
